# CacheReplacementPolicies

A comprehensive C++ implementation of various cache replacement policies. This project provides efficient and well-tested implementations of common cache replacement algorithms used in computer systems, including LRU (Least Recently Used), LFU (Least Frequently Used), FIFO (First In First Out), and other popular caching strategies.


## Supported Policies

- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Evicts the least recently accessed item
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Evicts the least frequently accessed item
- **FIFO (First In First Out)**: Evicts items in the order they were added
- **Random**: Randomly selects items for eviction
- **Clock**: Circular buffer-based replacement policy
- **ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache)**: Self-tuning cache replacement policy

This project serves as both a practical library for cache implementations and an educational resource for understanding different cache replacement policies.
